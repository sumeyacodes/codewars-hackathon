# THE HORSE SIZED DUCK ATTACK KATA üåü

## Project Overview

This project is a hackathon challenge focused on creating a Code Wars-style kata. The goal was to develop a problem related to data manipulation and categorisation, then validate the solution by writing unit tests using **Vitest**. The main challenge involves working with API data and categorising the ducks based on status codes, allowing participants to practice handling APIs, nested objects, and arrays.

# Planning Phase

## Project Requirements

- Design a kata that encourages participants to practice handling API data and categorising nested objects and arrays
- Write unit tests using **Vitest** to ensure the solution meets all requirements

## Brainstorming

- **Farm Animals Idea**: Initially inspired by farm animals, but the duck theme was definitely more engaging.
- **Horse-Size Duck: Final Challenge**: Based on the question: _Would you rather fight a hundred little ducks or a horse-sized duck?_
- **Duck HTTP Status Codes API**: Using [https://random-d.uk/api](https://random-d.uk/api).
- **Nested Objects & Arrays**: Manipulate API data containing nested objects and arrays.
- **Asynchronous Data**: Practice handling promises and async/await with API calls.
- **Data Manipulation**: Participants will parse and manipulate API data to group ducks based on their status codes.

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 1**: Set up project structure and dependencies.
  - [x] Install **Vitest** for testing.
  - [x] Set up initial project folder structure.
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement API fetch function.
  - [x] Research API fetching methods.
  - [x] Implement fetch logic and handle responses.
- [x] **Task 3**: Categorise ducks based on status codes.
  - [x] Parse API response data.
  - [x] Group ducks into categories.
- [x] **Task 4**: Write unit tests using Vitest.
  - [x] Test API response handling.
  - [x] Test categorisation logic.

| Testing the API using Vitest           | Ran into multiple approaches for mocking API requests, which I found difficult to implement. Realised this wasn't the focus of the hackathon, so decided to implement second function to focus on testing function logic instead of actual API fetch calls. This led to the creation of **Easy Mode** and **Hard Mode**: <br> **Easy Mode**: Focuses on second function for data manipulation with the `fetch` API function already implemented. <br> **Hard Mode**: Requires participants to `fetch` data from the API and handle asynchronous responses, adding complexity, as well as function for data manipulation|
| Categorising ducks from nested data    | Had to figure out how to access nested properties reliably. Used object destructuring and array manipulation.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Handling asynchronous data with Vitest | Initially struggled with async testing. Used `async/await` to resolve promises in tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

# How to play

## Challenge Overview

A wild mummy duck appears in front of you. She is angry because her ducklings are missing, and she blames YOU!
She orders you to fetch all her ducklings immediately, and organise them based on a very specific structure. 

In this kata, you'll work with an API that serves duck images and their associated status codes. Your mission is to create a categorisation system that sorts these ducks based on their status codes into nested objects and arrays, as if you're organising an army of little ducklings  ü¶Ü

## What You'll Learn

- API data handling
- Working with nested objects and arrays
- Data categorisation and manipulation
- Asynchronous programming


## Difficulty Modes

### üê• Easy Mode

- Pre-implemented API fetch functionality.
- Focus purely on duck categorisation logic.
- Perfect for practicing data structure manipulation.

### ü¶¢ Hard Mode

- Implement your own API fetch functionality.
- Handle asynchronous operations.

# Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/week-6-hackathon-sumeyacodes.git
```

### 2. Choose your battleground:

#### For Easy Mode

```bash
cd "easy mode"
```

#### For Hard Mode

```bash
cd "hard mode"
```

## Good luck & happy coding ! ü¶Ü
